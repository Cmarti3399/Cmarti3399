Hi, I am Craig Martinez.
Recently graduated with an AAS in Cyber Security. Sec+ certified as well.
Currently, working as an Azure Support Engineer, specifically on App Service.
Just started on 7/6/21, so I am still fresh into the tech career. 

At the level where I know syntax well, just need to actually code now. 
Spent time learning a few langauges in school. I wasn't really sure about the 
differeneces, but now I have a more narrow scope on what I'd like to learn. 
Languages (now) - Python, Java, C++
Languages (future) - C#, JavaScript, Go, PHP

Still a n00b so any help is appreciated ðŸ˜ƒ
Reach me @ martinez.craig94@gmail.com
